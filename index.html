				My name is Sunny Sun (yes, that's actually my name!) and I'm currently a student strategist studying political and economic policies at the University of California, Berkeley.   
				<p>
				I'm a passionate individual who is interested in understanding the world and creating memorable works, and because of that I have strong career interests in advertising and market research.  In my free time I love to play basketball and watch all the movies I can at my local theatre.  I'm a die-hard Laker fan and If you can't already tell, I am a Los Angeles native.
				<p>
				If you ever have any questions about my experience or my career, feel free to check out my resume or email me at sunnyjsun1@gmail.com
